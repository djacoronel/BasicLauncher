# Sleek Launcher
This is just a simplistic launcher that is basically just an app drawer. Also meant as a learning opportunity in creating an android homescreen replacement type of app.

Wasn't really able to focus on the architecture of the app that's why the the structure isn't that cohesive. Will work on code architecture on my next project.
